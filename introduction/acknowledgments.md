# Acknowledgments

The EdgeTX team has no intention of making a profit from their work. EdgeTX is free and open source and will remain free and open source. But EdgeTX is more expensive to maintain than most open source projects. The reason is that there is a never ending flood of hardware to integrate and maintain code for. Hardware that costs.
