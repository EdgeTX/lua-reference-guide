# Acknowledgments

The EdgeTX team has no intention of making a profit from their work - EdgeTX is free and open source and will remain free and open source. However, the project is more expensive to maintain than most open source projects. This in mainly because there is a never ending flood of hardware to integrate and maintain code for. Hardware that costs. In addition, in order to develop for this hardware, certain specalised test and measurement equipment is also required.

In order to support this, EdgeTX has chosen to use OpenCollective to allow for donations from the community, as well as funding from manufacturers who choose to partner with and sponsor the project. This also allows for transparent accounting of what the funds are spent on.

Please visit [our OpenCollective page](https://opencollective.com/edgetx) if you would like to financially help support the project!
