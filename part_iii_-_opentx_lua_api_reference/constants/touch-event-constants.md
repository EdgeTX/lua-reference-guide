  In addition to the key events described in the previous section, radios with a
  color touch screen also provide touch events to the widget scripts.

# Touch Event Constants

The following touch events are passed in the `event` argument to the widget script `refresh` function \(when in full screen mode\), just like the key events. The following touch events are provided:

| Touch Event Name | Description |
| :---: | :---: |
| EVT\_TOUCH_\__FIRST | When the finger touches down on the screen |
| EVT\_TOUCH_\__TAP | If the finger leaves the screen after a quick tap |
| EVT\_TOUCH_\__BREAK | If the finger leaves the screen without tap or slide |
| EVT\_TOUCH_\__SLIDE | Repeats while the finger is sliding on the screen |

In addition to the above touch events a `touchState` table is passed to `refresh` with the following addional data fields:

| touchState fields | Description |
| :---: | :---: |
| x, y | Current touch point |
| startX, startY | Point where slide started |
| slideX, SlideY | Movement since previous SLIDE event \(or start of slide\) |
| swipeUp / swipeDown / swipeLeft / swipeRight | The field is present and equal to `true` if a swipe event occurred in that direction |

### Notes:

* `touchState` is `nil` if `event` is not a touch event. This can be used to test if we have a touch event or a key event. 
  * Since Lua evaluates a `nil` value to `false` and everything else to `true`:
  * `if touchState then` we have a touch event.
* `x, y` are present for all touch events.
* `startX, startY, slideX, slideY` are only present with `EVT_TOUCH_SLIDE`.
* `swipeUp` / `swipeDown` / `swipeLeft` / `swipeRight` _may_ be present only with`EVT_TOUCH_SLIDE`.
