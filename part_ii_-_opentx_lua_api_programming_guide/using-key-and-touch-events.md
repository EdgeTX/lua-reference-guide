# Using Key and Touch Events

The two Lua widgets **EventDemo** and **LibGUI** are provided on the SD card content for color screen radios. EventDemo is just a small widget showing off how key and especially touch events can be used. LibGUI contains a globally available library that can be used by other widgets. This section will discuss these two widgets for color screen radios, but generally, what is stated here about key events here also applies to the `run` function in Telemetry and One-Time scripts.
