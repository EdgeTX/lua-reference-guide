The latest version of this guide will always be available [here](https://luadoc.edgetx.org). At the top of the left sidebar there is a version option if you are running an older version of EdgeTX and need the docs for that specific version.

Please feel free to make suggestions or corrections to the documentation on GitHub, but the preferred method of editing is to use [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com), so all changes will need to be made by someone who is authorized as a writer there.

This guide covers the development of user-written scripts for R/C transmitters running the EdgeTX operating system with Lua support. Readers should be familiar with EdgeTX, the EdgeTX Companion, and know how to transfer files the SD card in the transmitter.

If you are new to Lua programming, you may also find the [Lua Reference Manual](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/) of assistance.

Part I is an overview of the different script types, along with basic examples of each.

Part II is a programming guide that introduces the types of EdgeTX Lua scripts and how to use them.

Part III is the EdgeTX Lua API Reference

Part IV covers advanced topics with examples


## Acknowledgments

The EdgeTX team has no intention of making a profit from their work - EdgeTX is free and open source and will remain free and open source. However, the project is more expensive to maintain than most open source projects. This in mainly because there is a never ending flood of hardware to integrate and maintain code for. Hardware that costs. In addition, in order to develop for this hardware, certain specalised test and measurement equipment is also required.

In order to support this, EdgeTX has chosen to use OpenCollective to allow for donations from the community, as well as funding from manufacturers who choose to partner with and sponsor the project. This also allows for transparent accounting of what the funds are spent on.

Please visit [our OpenCollective page](https://opencollective.com/edgetx) if you would like to financially help support the project!
